# Sorting Visualizer

A beautiful, interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Compare and learn how different sorting algorithms work through animated, side-by-side visualizations.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## ✨ Features
- **Visualize**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort
- **Side-by-side comparison**: See all algorithms animate on the same array
- **Interactive controls**: Adjust array size and animation speed
- **Pause, resume, and reset**: Control each algorithm's animation
- **Time complexity display**: See the time complexity for each algorithm
- **Responsive design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile
- **Modern UI**: Clean, colorful, and easy to use
